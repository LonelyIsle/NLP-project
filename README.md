**NLP-project**

This project aims to find relevant reviews in a large data set after implementing and evaluating 3 different models: boolean_search, 
M1(uses a polarity filter) and M2(uses a polarity filter, proximity filter, and review titles). This is mostly done to ensure that only relevant
reviews are presented to the user based on their search.
