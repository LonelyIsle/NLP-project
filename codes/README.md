To run the code examples in this directory:

1. **Install python / other dependencies like Pandas**:
    Make sure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

    install pandas with:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas
    ```

2. **To get each method to run you need to cd into the codes folder and run**:
    ```bash
    python boolean_search.py
    python m1.py
    python m2.py
    ```

3. **Check the outputs**:
    Each script saves its output in the codes folder under their own output folder with the titles per each method with a matching filename.
